# Lending-Club

## Description
* Lending Club is a US Peer to Peer Loan Company. It enables the borrowers to create unsecured personal Loans between $1000 and $40,000.
* The Loan period is for a standard three years. The investors can select the loans which they want to invest into based on information supplied about the borrower, grade of loan, loan purpose etc. 
* Lending club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors  a service Fee.

## Motivation 
* People save money in the banks but that offers them with lower interest rates. 
* Lending club is helping in transforming the banking sector by making credit more affordable and investing more rewarding. 
* Here we need to classify each of the borrower as a defaulter or not using the data collected when the loan has been given. 

## Problem Statement
* To Classify if a borrower will default the loan using the borrower's financial history. 
* We need to predict the target variable as  1> paid off and 0 > charged off.
* The metrics we use for  the problem:
   * AUC â€“ ROC Curve
   * Accuracy 
   * Time Taken 

## Procedure
Here is the code for the Lending club data analysis where I have performed the following:
* Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis 
* Model evaluation using different Machine learing models which were as follows : 
    *  Linear Regression 
    *  Logistic Regression 
    *  Support Vector Machine 
    *  K nearest Neighbour 
    *  XG Boosting 
    *  Neural Network 
* Comparision of the Models and choose the best one based on three factors.
